<h1>Brief Background</h1>

<p>I was born in 1966 in New Jersey.  Lived in Paramus, NJ through high school.  Went to the University of Maine for a Pre-veterinary degree, ended up majoring in alcohol consumption and left after a year.  Received an Associates Degree from Johnson & Wales in Providence, Rhode Island. I met my wife at J&W. We married a year and two months after first meeting, and have been married for going on 28 yrs this May.  We have two children, Michael 20, Nicole 17.  We have two rescue dogs, Buster a 5 yr old Sheppard mix who we rescued as a puppy, and Spartacus a 9-12 yr old Retriever mix who we rescued 3 yrs ago.</p>

	<h4>Paramus, New Jersey</h4>
	<p>The Borough of Paramus is a town of approximately 27,000 people. It is located in the north east corner of New Jersey and occupies around 10,500 sq miles of land. Paramus generates over $5 billion in retail sales annually, the most in any single zip code in the country. That being said, Paramus has strict blue laws which prohibit retail stores from being open on Sundays.  Grocery stores, gas stations, and restaurants are the exception. Paramus was originally occupied by the Lenape Indians, who named the area Peremessing, meaning an abundance of wild turkeys. Ridgewood Country Club is one of the top ranked golf courses in the country.  Paramus boasts many other parks and historical sites.</p>
